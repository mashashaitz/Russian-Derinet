The programmes are written in jupyter notebooks, Python 3.8.2.

There are two programmes:

1) "LogReg + DecTree.ipynb" creates the dataset of most eligible parent-children word pairs, using Logistic Regression and Decision Trees classifiers.

2) "to_uder_NX.ipynb" cleans the least probable parent-child parents from the dataset and afterwords does the harmonization of data to bring it to UDer format.

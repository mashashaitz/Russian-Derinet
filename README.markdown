#### Ignashina Maria, Olga Lyashevskaya, 2020, NRU HSE thesis.
The code is divided in two bits: machine learning module and harmonisation, both are located in the "code" folder.

Both programmes require files from "preprocessed dicts" to be in the SAME directory as the programmes.

The resulting database and testing files are in the "result" folder.

The source dictionaries are in the "raw_dicts" folder.

######Thank you for the attention!
